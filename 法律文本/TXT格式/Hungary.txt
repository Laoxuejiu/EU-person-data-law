ACCESS TO DATA OF PUBLIC INTEREST
20. General rules on access to data of public interest
Section 26

(2) The name of the person acting within the functions and powers of the organ performing public duties, as well as his functions and duties, executive mandate, his other personal data relevant to performing public duties, and his personal data to which access is ensured by an Act, shall qualify as data accessible on public interest grounds. Personal data accessible on public interest grounds shall be disseminated in compliance with the principle of data processing limited to the intended purpose. Publishing personal data accessible on public interest grounds on the website shall be regulated by Annex 1 of this Act and a specific Act relating to the legal status of persons performing public duties.
(3) Unless otherwise provided by an Act, any data other than personal data that is in connection with the activities of and processed by organs or persons providing services that are mandatory by virtue of law, or under a contract concluded with any state or local government organ, or services which are impossible to be performed otherwise, shall be deemed data accessible on public interest grounds.
(4) In the course of fulfilling a request for access to data specified in paragraph (3), the organ or person specified in paragraph (3) shall act in accordance with sections 28 to 31.
Section 27 
(1) No access to data of public interest or data accessible on public interest grounds shall be provided if it has been classified under the Act on the protection of classified data.
(2) The right to access data of public interest or data accessible on public interest grounds may be restricted by an Act, with the specific type of data indicated, if considered necessary for the purposes of a) national defence; b) national security; c) the prosecution and prevention of criminal offences; d) environmental protection and nature preservation; e) central financial or foreign exchange policy; f) external relations, relations with international organisations; g) court proceedings or administrative authority procedures; h) intellectual property rights.
(3) As data accessible on public interest grounds, the following shall not qualify as business secret: the budget of the central government and the local governments; furthermore, data related to the use of European Union funds, to benefits and allowances involving the budget, to the management, possession, use, utilisation and the disposal and encumbering of central and local government assets, and the acquisition of any right in connection with such assets, as well as data, the accessibility or publication of which is prescribed on public interest grounds by a specific Act. Disclosure, however, shall not entail access to data, to know-how in particular, the making available of which would cause disproportionate harm with respect to the performance of business activities, provided that this does not prevent the possibility of access to data accessible on public interest grounds.
(3a) A natural person, legal person or organisation having no legal personality that establishes a financial or business relationship with a person belonging to one of the subsystems of the public finances shall, upon request, provide information to anyone with respect to data that is public on public interest grounds based on paragraph (3) and that is in connection with such a relationship. The obligation to provide information can be fulfilled by disclosing the data accessible on public interest grounds, or by indicating the public source that contains the data disclosed earlier in an electronic form.
(3b) If the party obliged to provide information on the basis of paragraph (3a) refuses to provide the information, the party requesting information may initiate the procedure of the organ authorised to exercise legal supervision over the party obliged to provide information.
(4) Access to data of public interest may also be limited on the basis of a legal act of the European Union with a view to safeguarding vital economic or financial interests of the European Union, including monetary, fiscal and tax policies.
(5) Any data compiled or recorded by an organ performing public duties as part and in support of its decision-making process within the limits of its powers and duties shall not be disclosed for ten years from the date it was compiled or recorded. After considering the weight of public interest with respect to granting or denying access, the head of the organ that processes the data in question may permit access.
(6) A request to access data underlying a decision may be dismissed after the decision is adopted but within the time limit referred to in paragraph (5), if the data underlies future decisions, or access to it would jeopardise the lawful functioning of the organ performing public duties, or would jeopardise the performance of its duties without any undue external influence, such as, in particular, the free expression of the standpoint of the organ which generated the data during the preliminary stages of its decision-making process.
(7) The time limit for the restriction of access to certain specific data underlying a decision as specified in paragraph (5) may be reduced by law.
(8) The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to the provision of data from registers of certified authenticity and subject to the provisions of another specific Act.

Section 28 
(1) Data of public interest shall be made available to anyone upon a request presented orally, in writing or by electronic means. Access to data accessible on public interest grounds shall be governed by the provisions of this Act pertaining to data of public interest.
(2) Unless otherwise provided by an Act, processing the personal data of the requesting party is permitted only to the extent necessary for fulfilling the request, or assessing the request on the basis of the conditions referred to in section 29 (1a), or paying the fee determined for the fulfilment of the request. Following the expiry of the interval referred to in section 29 (1a), or following the payment of the fee, the personal data of the requesting party shall be erased without delay.
(3) If the request for data is unclear, the controller shall call on the requesting party to clarify it.
Section 29 
(1) The organ performing public duties and processing the data of public interest shall fulfil the request for access to such data as soon as possible, but not later than 15 days from receiving the request.
(1a) The organ performing public duties and processing the data shall not be obliged to fulfil the request for data with respect to the part of the data that had already been requested by the same requesting party and is aimed at an identical set of data, provided that the data belonging to the identical set of data did not change.
(1b) The organ performing public duties and processing the data shall not be obliged to fulfil the request for data if the requesting party fails to indicate his name, its identity, in the case of other than a natural person, or the contact information through which it could be notified and informed in connection with the request for data.
(2) If the request concerns data large in number or in volume, or if fulfilling the request for data requires a disproportionate use of the labour resources needed for the performance of the core duties of an organ performing public duties, the time limit referred to in paragraph (1) may be extended by 15 days on one occasion, of which the requesting party shall be informed within 15 days of the date of receiving the request.
(2a) If the request for data involves data that is generated by an institution of the European Union or its Member States, the controller shall contact the institution of the European Union or the Member State concerned without delay and shall inform the requesting party thereof. The interval between providing this information and the controller’s receipt of the response of the European Union institution or the Member State concerned shall not be taken into account when calculating the time limit for fulfilling the request for data.
(3) The requesting party may also be provided with a copy of the document or a part of the document containing the data in question, irrespective of the form of storage. The organ performing public duties and processing the data may charge a fee amounting to the costs incurred by the fulfilment of the request, and shall communicate this amount to the requesting party in advance.
(3a) The requesting party shall make a statement within 30 days from receiving the information as per paragraph (3) as to whether he wishes to maintain his request or not. The interval between providing the information and the receipt of the requesting party’s statement shall not be taken into account when calculating the time limit available for the fulfilment of the request. If the requesting party maintains his request, he shall pay the fee to the controller within the time limit determined by the controller, of at least 15 days.
(4) If fulfilling the request for data requires a disproportionate use of the labour resources needed for the performance of the core duties of an organ performing public duties, or the document or a part of the document of which the copy had been requested is large, or if the amount of the fee exceeds the amount determined in a government decree, the request shall be fulfilled within 15 days from the date on which the payment of the fee was made by the requesting party. Within 15 days from the date of receipt of his request, the requesting party shall be notified that the fulfilment of his request for data requires a disproportionate use of the labour resources necessary for the performance of the core duties of an organ performing public duties, or the document or a part of the document of which he requested the copy is large, also regarding the amount of the fee and the possibility of fulfilling the request without making copies.
(5) When determining the fee, the following items may be taken into account: a) the cost of the data medium that will contain the requested data; b) the cost incurred by delivering the data medium containing the requested data to the requesting party; and c) the cost of labour related to fulfilling the data request if fulfilling the request for data requires a disproportionate use of the labour resources necessary for the performance of the core duties of an organ performing public duties.
(6) The fee items referred to in paragraph (5) that may be charged shall be determined by law.
Section 30 
(1) If a document containing data of public interest also contains any other data that the requesting party may not access, the data that must not be accessed shall be made unrecognisable on the copy.

A request for data shall not be dismissed on the grounds that it cannot be complied with in a comprehensible form.
(3) If a request for data is refused, the requesting party shall be notified thereof within 15 days in writing or, if the requesting party has given his electronic mailing address, by electronic means, and he shall be informed of the reasons for refusal, and the legal remedies that are available for him under this Act. The controller shall keep records on the requests dismissed, including the reasons for them, and shall inform the Authority of them each year, by 31 January.
(4) A request for data of public interest made by a person whose native language is not Hungarian shall not be refused because it was written in the requesting party’s native language, or in any other language he understands.
(5) If the controller is vested with discretionary authority by an Act with respect to the refusal of requests for access to data of public interest, the grounds serving for refusal shall be interpreted restrictively, and the request for access to data of public interest shall only be refused if the underlying public interest outweighs the public interest of allowing access to the data of public interest.
(6) Organs performing public duties shall adopt regulations governing the procedures for fulfilling requests for access to data of public interest.
(7) Access to data aiming to provide a comprehensive examination of the financial management of organs performing public duties, including accounting and itemised audits, shall be regulated in specific Acts. By referring to this, the controller may, instead of providing a copy of the document containing the requested data, also fulfil the request by indicating the persons involved in the legal relationship, the type of the legal relationship, the subject of the legal relationship and the volume of the service and the amount of consideration paid, as well as the date of performance.
Section 31 
(1) In the event that the request for access to data of public interest of a requesting party is dismissed, or the time limit or, if the controller extended it pursuant to section 29 (2), the extended time limit expires with no result, as well as for the judicial review of the fee determined for the fulfilment of the request, the requesting party may turn to court.
(2) The burden of proof for the lawfulness and the reasons for refusal, as well as the reasons based on which the amount of the fee is payable for fulfilling the request, shall lie with the controller.
(3) The action shall be brought against the organ performing public duties that dismissed the request within thirty days from communicating the dismissal, the expiry of the time limit with no result, or the time limit for the payment of the fee. If the requesting party makes a notification to the Authority aimed at initiating the Authority’s inquiry regarding the dismissal or the non-fulfilment of the request, or with respect to the amount of the fee charged for fulfilling the request, the action may be brought within thirty days following the receipt of the notification of the refusal to examine the request on its merits, of the termination of the inquiries, of its conclusion under section 55 (1) b), or of the notification under section 58 (3). An application for excuse may be submitted in the event of failure to meet the time limit for bringing the action.
(4) Any person who does not otherwise have the capacity to be a party may be a party to the court action. The Authority may intervene in the action in order to facilitate the success of the requesting party.
(5) With the exception of actions brought against organs performing public duties having national territorial competence, the action shall be brought before a district court having territorial jurisdiction and located where the regional court has its seat or before the Pest Central District Court in Budapest. The territorial jurisdiction of the court shall be established by the location of the seat of the organ performing public duties acting as defendant.
(6) The court shall hear such cases as a matter of priority. (6a) If the request for access to data of public interest is refused by the controller on the basis of section 27 (1), and the requesting party turns to court on the basis of paragraph (1) for the judicial review of the dismissal of his request, the court shall initiate an administrative authority procedure for the review of the data classification with the Authority and shall simultaneously suspend the court proceedings. No separate appeal shall be available against the order initiating the administrative authority procedure for the review of the data classification or suspending the court proceedings.
(7) If the decision of the court is in favour of the request for access to data of public interest, the court shall, also determining the applicable time limit for fulfilling the request, order the controller to disclose the data of public interest. The court may modify the amount charged for fulfilling the request for access to the data of public interest, or may order the organ performing public duties to commence a new procedure to determine the amount of the fee payable.
